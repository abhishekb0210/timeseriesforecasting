### Project: Analyse and Predict Customer Service Requests
This project reflects the implementations for Time Series forecasting using LSTM and ARIMA model with single variable and multiple variables.
#### Results of LSTM:
Outcome of LSTM with multiple features is far better than outcome with single input feature. While considering multiple features, we've also taken the lags of previos 7 days for prediction. The RMSE error have reduced more than 10 times because of multiple features & lags.
#### Results of ARIMA:
The RMSE of ARIMA with single feature is quite poor.
